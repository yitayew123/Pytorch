# PyTorch Tensor Basics 🧮🔥

This repository introduces PyTorch Tensors, the fundamental building blocks for deep learning and machine learning. Tensors extend matrices to higher dimensions, enabling efficient data manipulation, especially for GPU-accelerated computations. 🚀
## 🔑 What Are Tensors?

Tensors represent data across dimensions:

   * Scalar (0-D Tensor): A single numerical value.
   * Vector (1-D Tensor): A sequence of values, like a list.
   * Matrix (2-D Tensor): A table of values with rows and columns.
   * 3-D Tensor: Data with three dimensions, such as images. 🖼️
   * N-D Tensor: Higher-dimensional data, like video frames or data batches. 🎥

## 📂 Tensor Data Types

### PyTorch supports a variety of data types, including:

  <b> float32</b> (default for floating-point numbers)
  <b>int32</b> and <b>int64</b> (for integers)
  <b>bool</b> (for binary values)
  <b>complex64</b> (for complex numbers)

### Understanding data types is crucial for ensuring computational efficiency. ⚡
### 🌟 Practical Use Cases

  * Scalar: Represent a single measurement (e.g., temperature 🌡️).
  * Vector: Store features for a single data point.
  * Matrix: Represent neural network weights. 🧠
  * 3-D Tensor: Process grayscale or color images. 🌈
  * N-D Tensor: Handle complex data like videos or large data batches. 🎞️
